# Project Mani: Ferrofluid Research Database

**To:** Professor of Mechanical Engineering  
**From:** AI Research Assistant  
**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Subject:** Overview of Data & Proposed Analytical Support

Dear Professor,

I have successfully processed your Excel datasets into a structured CSV format. Below is a summary of the data we currently hold and a precise outline of how I can assist you in analyzing this research landscape.

### 1. Current Data Overview
We have established a comprehensive database consisting of three core pillars:
*   **Taxonomy:** A structured classification system (Codes 11–51) dividing the field into *Materials*, *Computation*, and *Applications*.
*   **Literature:** A bibliography of academic papers (exported from Scopus), including abstracts and metadata.
*   **Intellectual Property:** A complete timeline of patents ranging from foundational work (1969–2009) to modern innovations (2010–Present).

### 2. How I Can Assist You
I can act as an interactive analyst to help you derive insights without you needing to write code. Here are the specific tasks I can perform immediately:

*   **Automated Classification:**
    I can read the abstracts of the unclassified papers in your Scopus list and automatically assign them the correct class code (e.g., *40 for Medical/Hyperthermia* or *22 for CFD*) based on your taxonomy. This will save you hours of manual sorting.

*   **Trend Analysis & Visualization:**
    I can generate charts showing the evolution of the field. For example:
    *   *“Show me the decline of 'Seals' patents versus the rise of 'Biomedical' patents over the last 20 years.”*
    *   *“Which universities are publishing the most on Ferrofluid Heat Transfer?”*

*   **Gap Analysis:**
    I can identify which sub-classes in your system are under-researched. If Class 39 (Robotic Surgery) has very few entries compared to Class 47 (Seals), we can highlight this as a potential area for new research or review.

*   **Patent-to-Paper Correlation:**
    I can cross-reference authors and inventors to see which academic researchers are also filing patents, helping you identify key industry-academic partnerships.

### 3. Next Steps
To begin, you might ask me to:
> *"Classify the top 50 most cited papers from the Scopus list according to our system."*
or
> *"Create a graph showing the number of ferrofluid patents per year since 1980."*

I am ready to proceed with any of these tasks at your instruction.

Respectfully,
