While using Ferrofluids for heat transfer enhancement, the external magnetic field usually induces Kelvin Body Force, which causes the ferrofluid to swirl or 'mix'. This mixing process causes extra convection over what is induced through fluid inertia and is responsible for heat transfer enhancement. In order to understand the phenomenon of heat transfer enhancement, it would be logical to view it from the perspective of mixing enhancement. Moreover, channel flows are most common in liquid cooling of electronics equipment, and hence such a fundamental understanding of synergies between mixing and heat transfer enhancement can help pose design rules for advanced cooling configuration for electronics cooling. In this work, a Ferrofluid channel flow is analyzed in the presence of an external magnetic field. A 2-D 90° bend channel ferrofluid flow is considered, with a significant length scale of 0.01 m, where two external current-carrying wires provide an external magnetic field. An external inward heat flux of 1000 W/m2 is applied on the walls of the channel. The channel flow is studied numerically by varying different parameters relating to the external magnetic field and flow conditions. The ferrofluid used is considered magnetite based on water as the carrier fluid, and the properties of which are modeled using appropriate mixture models for nanofluids. The mixing induced in the flow is characterized by using two different mixing numbers based on the flow velocity. This type of characterization is analogous to characterizing flow turbulence. The heat transfer enhancement is characterized using Nusselt numbers. These non-dimensional numbers (mixing) are studied in congruence with the Nusselt number to understand the relationship between the mixing and heat transfer and draw comparative inferences with flow conditions without heat transfer enhancement. Finally, conclusions are drawn between the mixing & heat transfer intensification at local and global levels and choosing the apposite mixing numbers to characterize heat transfer enhancement.

It seems therefore appropriate to tak e up this current interest in science and medicine, which has been intensified by media, and to address medical topics in STEM lessons to motivate students [1]. Beyond COVID-19, however, research continues into many areas such as cancer or anti-inflammatory strategies [2]. A promising approach for the treatment of both examples (and many more) is related to nanotechnology. Nanomaterials can be used as a transport system for active ingredients and transport them more specifically to the location where they are intended to work. It is therefore k nown as ""drug delivery"" or ""drug targeting"" [2,3]. But the nanomaterial itself can also be used as an active ingredient or adjuvant for a therapy. Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) are an important material for both approaches. Due to their outstanding magnetic properties, their good biocompatibility and good availability, they are subject of many research projects and offer great potential for modern medical solutions either as part of a carrier system or, for example, to induce heat to damage cancer cells [4]. The synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles with educational means is already sufficiently documented and ferrofluids are already available for purchase at low cost on the Internet. This results in the potential combination of medicine and nanotechnology, which provides a wide range of learning opportunities for STEM education. In this contribution will be shown how magnetite nanoparticl es can be synthesized with simple school chemicals and stabilized as ferrofluids. Subsequently, the ferrofluid will be used in a model experiment to illustrate the hypothermic treatment of tumor cells and first practical experiences with students in the student laboratory will be presented. © 2021, Pixel Associazione.

The CoxFe3-xO4 (0.8≤x ≤ 0) magnetic nanoparticles dispersed NMFs have been synthesized by a wet chemical method. The effect of cobalt concentration variation on magnetic properties has been probed in detail. The anisotropy and magnetic properties are significantly dependent on the concentration of the cobalt which has been investigated by room temperature dc magnetic measurement (M-H). The M-H plot indicates that the optimized concentration of the cobalt in the system leads to an increase in the saturation magnetization of the NMFs from 43.87 emu/g to 61.78 emu/g at an optimized concentration (x = 0.2). This can be correlated to the distribution of cations on tetrahedral and octahedral sites. A 24% Cobalt (Co2+) substitution from tetrahedral sites in place of Fe3+ ions increases the exchange interaction among tetrahedral and octahedral sites resulting in improvement in the magnetic performance of the NMFs. Although, after the critical concentration (>0.2) of Cobalt doping, the net exchange interaction decreases which result in a lowering of magnetic saturation for the higher concentration of Cobalt doping. Further, the structural properties of these fluids have been investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The cation distribution of XRD patterns has been identified by the Le Bail Rietveld refinement technique that confirms the single cubic spinel phase belonging to the Fd-3m space group. The structural distribution correlated with the magnetic properties indicates that the variation in the composition of the mixed ferrites systems significantly affects the magnetic behavior. The optimized concentration of doping helps in improving the performance of NMFs which is a key bottleneck in the development of NMF applications such as biomedical, thermoelectric, EMI shielding, and spintronics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","The paper optimizes cobalt concentration in CoxFe3-xO4 mixed ferrite nanomagnetic fluids for improved magnetic characteristics and stability."

The dearth of documentation on the trio influence of volume concentration, base fluid, and temperature on the electrical conductivity and viscosity of hybrid alumina–ferrofluids [Al2O3–Fe2O3 (25:75 mass%)] has led to this study. The effective viscosity and electrical conductivity of the deionized water (DW)-based and ethylene glycol (EG)–DW-based (50:50 vol%) hybrid alumina–ferrofluids were measured at temperatures of 20–50 °C and volume concentrations of 0.05–0.75%. Based on the importance of soft computing methods to engineers, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used for predicting the relative viscosity and electrical conductivity of the two types of hybrid ferrofluids. The measured data for viscosity and electrical conductivity were used in the modeling. Model performances were evaluated using the root mean squared error index. Viscosity was enhanced by 3.23–43.64% and 2.79–49.38%, while electrical conductivity was increased by 163.37–1692.16% and 717.14–7618.89% for the DW- and EG–DIW-based hybrid ferrofluids, respectively, compared with the respective base fluids. Increasing volume concentration augmented the viscosity and electrical conductivity of all the hybrid alumina–ferrofluids, whereas a rise in temperature enhanced their electrical conductivity and detracted the viscosity. DW-based hybrid alumina–ferrofluid was observed to have a lower viscosity and higher electrical conductivity than the EG–DW-based counterpart. The results showed that the optimum ANN and ANFIS models have a maximum error of less than 4.5% and 3.9% for relative viscosity and electrical conductivity, respectively, which were lower than those proposed using regression analysis.

A robust and effective method of fine particle size characterization is presented. It is based on the core–shell model and the analysis of the dependence of saturation magnetization on particle concentration. A novel advantage method has been used as a straightforward way to determine the concentration dependence of the effective field related to particle interaction that was calculated from the experimentally obtained concentration dependence of low field susceptibility. The computed relationship is compared with the concentration dependences of effective fields derived from several well-known theoretical models. We present some peculiarities of the real part of dynamic magnetic susceptibility on temperature. Investigated features are defined both by the magnetic state of fine particles and by crystallization of carrier at the liquid to a solid phase transition. For the first time, the dependence of the magnetization relaxation time on the colloidal particle concentration and the magnitude of bias DC magnetic field was investigated experimentally. Results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for moderate concentration and significantly differs for concentration greater 7 vol%. It is concluded that this effect can be related either to the enhanced particle interaction or to the transition of some particles from superparamagnetic to a ferromagnetic state.

The interaction of magnetic nanoparticles with magnetic forces and the resulting structural changes in the ferrofluids may tune their dielectric spectra. In this paper, we present an experimental study on the controllability of a dielectric spectrum of Mn-Zn ferrite transformer oil-based ferrofluid by means of a static electric field generated by a direct current (DC) bias voltage. Two experimental configurations of the DC bias voltage are applied. The spectrum of a complex permittivity measured in the frequency range from 1 mHz up to 200 kHz is firstly studied under an internal DC bias voltage applied on the electrodes of a measuring capacitor. Then, the sensitivity of the dielectric spectrum to the external DC bias voltage applied on an external pair of electrodes outside the measuring capacitor is investigated. It is found that the increasing internal DC bias voltage significantly shifts the whole dielectric spectrum to lower frequencies and gives rise to higher permittivity values. The external DC bias voltage is remarkably less capable of such tuning. The obtained dielectric spectra are described by a fitting function composed of Havriliak-Negami and conductivity terms. The fitting parameters are compared in the analysis of the two DC bias voltage effects. An interfacial polarization on the nanoparticles is considered to dominate the dielectric spectrum. The aggregation of nanoparticles due to the induced electric polarization and the acting electric forces is discussed as a primary reason of the changes in the dielectric spectra. The DC bias voltage-tunable dielectric spectrum thus complements the controllability of ferrofluids by external forces and may open a new avenue of research and applications in electrical engineering. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","The paper experimentally studies the controllability of ferrofluids' dielectric spectrum using external electric forces."

The magnetic nanoparticle would undergo various structural transitions under external magnetic field, including chainlike formation and lateral coalescence which, in turn, leads to various interesting light transmission phenomena. It is thus possible to alter the properties of the transmitted light by adjusting the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to that of the incident light. The polarization direction of light has a negligible effect on the magneto-optical transmission while light passing along the magnetic field. However, it makes a significant difference for light normal to the field direction. These characteristics are comprehensively reviewed, and their potential applications are presented.

Particles interaction with their carrying flow or the surrounding tissues still needs to be completely understood, as well as the mechanisms underlying interparticle interactions. These interactions can potentially promote particles aggregation in the fluid doman and therefore influence the therapy outcome. This study presents a numerical model to describe particles magnetohydrodynamics in a realistic setup for magnetic drug targeting. The focus is a quantitative analysis of the contribution of the local ferrofluid concentration gradients to the magnetic fluid volume force, as well as an investigation on the dependence of the magnetic fluid volume force on particles diameter and ferrofluid concentration. The results show that the main contribution to the magnetic fluid volume force is the magnetic field gradients term. However, the concentration gradients term ranges in the same order of magnitude and therefore cannot be neglected in the force formulation. In addition, the molar concentration distribution has been found to change with different force formulations and with different values of the molar influx too. The model outlines that the magnetic fluid volume force increases with the particle diameter and the ferrofluid concentration. However, both relationships are not linear, but more complex. The described approach proves to be versatile and further applicable to more complex geometries and scenarios. In addition, the outcome and the achievements of the presented numerical model provide for the first time insights into the role of the local ferrofluid concentration gradients in the determination of the magnetic fluid volume force and represent a starting point for further investigations of the mechanisms underlying the flow-mediated ferrofluid mass transport. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","The paper presents a numerical model to investigate the influence of local particle concentration gradient forces on flow-mediated mass transport in magnetic drug targeting."

The elemental composition is optimized via the ratio of the precursor mixture and controlled by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Fine-tuning of the magnetic properties without changing the overall elemental composition is demonstrated by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Together with X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray emission spectroscopy, we confirm that the degree of cation inversion is altered by thermal annealing. We can correlate the magnetic properties with both the nanosize influence and the degree of inversion. The resulting nonlinear course of saturation magnetization (Ms) in correlation with the particle diameter allows to decouple crystallite size and saturation magnetization, by this providing a parameter for the production of very small nanoparticles with high Ms with great potential for magnetic applications like ferrofluids or targeted drug delivery.

The anti-wear issues of extremely unstable technological conditions such as frequent start-up motions is an intractable challenge. The strategy of employing ferrofluid lubrication in the start-up motion from ultra-low speed to operating speed is a potential approach to improving the severe wear of rough elliptical contact. This paper presents a revised mixed lubrication model that accounts for magnetic field circumstances. Considering Gaussian random roughness, time-varying effect, and thermal effect, the lubrication equations are numerically calculated. First, four start-up modes are evaluated and compared; then the differences between ferrofluids and base oil are quantitatively studied. Furthermore, the influences of ferromagnetic particle size and magnetic field intensity on the film formation and wear of rough elliptical contact are discussed. Results show that ferrofluid lubrication is of great significance in wear reduction compared with base oil. The start-up motion with high accelerated speed is advantageous in film lubrication and wear reduction.

While using Ferrofluids for heat transfer enhancement, the external magnetic field usually induces Kelvin Body Force, which causes the ferrofluid to swirl or 'mix'. This mixing process causes extra convection over what is induced through fluid inertia and is responsible for heat transfer enhancement. In order to understand the phenomenon of heat transfer enhancement, it would be logical to view it from the perspective of mixing enhancement. Moreover, channel flows are most common in liquid cooling of electronics equipment, and hence such a fundamental understanding of synergies between mixing and heat transfer enhancement can help pose design rules for advanced cooling configuration for electronics cooling. In this work, a Ferrofluid channel flow is analyzed in the presence of an external magnetic field. A 2-D 90° bend channel ferrofluid flow is considered, with a significant length scale of 0.01 m, where two external current-carrying wires provide an external magnetic field. An external inward heat flux of 1000 W/m2 is applied on the walls of the channel. The channel flow is studied numerically by varying different parameters relating to the external magnetic field and flow conditions. The ferrofluid used is considered magnetite based on water as the carrier fluid, and the properties of which are modeled using appropriate mixture models for nanofluids. The mixing induced in the flow is characterized by using two different mixing numbers based on the flow velocity. This type of characterization is analogous to characterizing flow turbulence. The heat transfer enhancement is characterized using Nusselt numbers. These non-dimensional numbers (mixing) are studied in congruence with the Nusselt number to understand the relationship between the mixing and heat transfer and draw comparative inferences with flow conditions without heat transfer enhancement. Finally, conclusions are drawn between the mixing & heat transfer intensification at local and global levels and choosing the apposite mixing numbers to characterize heat transfer enhancement.

It seems therefore appropriate to tak e up this current interest in science and medicine, which has been intensified by media, and to address medical topics in STEM lessons to motivate students [1]. Beyond COVID-19, however, research continues into many areas such as cancer or anti-inflammatory strategies [2]. A promising approach for the treatment of both examples (and many more) is related to nanotechnology. Nanomaterials can be used as a transport system for active ingredients and transport them more specifically to the location where they are intended to work. It is therefore k nown as ""drug delivery"" or ""drug targeting"" [2,3]. But the nanomaterial itself can also be used as an active ingredient or adjuvant for a therapy. Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) are an important material for both approaches. Due to their outstanding magnetic properties, their good biocompatibility and good availability, they are subject of many research projects and offer great potential for modern medical solutions either as part of a carrier system or, for example, to induce heat to damage cancer cells [4]. The synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles with educational means is already sufficiently documented and ferrofluids are already available for purchase at low cost on the Internet. This results in the potential combination of medicine and nanotechnology, which provides a wide range of learning opportunities for STEM education. In this contribution will be shown how magnetite nanoparticl es can be synthesized with simple school chemicals and stabilized as ferrofluids.

The CoxFe3-xO4 (0.8≤x ≤ 0) magnetic nanoparticles dispersed NMFs have been synthesized by a wet chemical method. The effect of cobalt concentration variation on magnetic properties has been probed in detail. The anisotropy and magnetic properties are significantly dependent on the concentration of the cobalt which has been investigated by room temperature dc magnetic measurement (M-H). The M-H plot indicates that the optimized concentration of the cobalt in the system leads to an increase in the saturation magnetization of the NMFs from 43.87 emu/g to 61.78 emu/g at an optimized concentration (x = 0.2). This can be correlated to the distribution of cations on tetrahedral and octahedral sites. A 24% Cobalt (Co2+) substitution from tetrahedral sites in place of Fe3+ ions increases the exchange interaction among tetrahedral and octahedral sites resulting in improvement in the magnetic performance of the NMFs. Although, after the critical concentration (>0.2) of Cobalt doping, the net exchange interaction decreases which result in a lowering of magnetic saturation for the higher concentration of Cobalt doping. Further, the structural properties of these fluids have been investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The cation distribution of XRD patterns has been identified by the Le Bail Rietveld refinement technique that confirms the single cubic spinel phase belonging to the Fd-3m space group. The structural distribution correlated with the magnetic properties indicates that the variation in the composition of the mixed ferrites systems significantly affects the magnetic behavior. The optimized concentration of doping helps in improving the performance of NMFs which is a key bottleneck in the development of NMF applications such as biomedical, thermoelectric, EMI shielding, and spintronics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","The paper optimizes cobalt concentration in CoxFe3-xO4 mixed ferrite nanomagnetic fluids for improved magnetic characteristics and stability."

The dearth of documentation on the trio influence of volume concentration, base fluid, and temperature on the electrical conductivity and viscosity of hybrid alumina–ferrofluids [Al2O3–Fe2O3 (25:75 mass%)] has led to this study. The effective viscosity and electrical conductivity of the deionized water (DW)-based and ethylene glycol (EG)–DW-based (50:50 vol%) hybrid alumina–ferrofluids were measured at temperatures of 20–50 °C and volume concentrations of 0.05–0.75%. Based on the importance of soft computing methods to engineers, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used for predicting the relative viscosity and electrical conductivity of the two types of hybrid ferrofluids. The measured data for viscosity and electrical conductivity were used in the modeling. Model performances were evaluated using the root mean squared error index. Viscosity was enhanced by 3.23–43.64% and 2.79–49.38%, while electrical conductivity was increased by 163.37–1692.16% and 717.14–7618.89% for the DW- and EG–DIW-based hybrid ferrofluids, respectively, compared with the respective base fluids. Increasing volume concentration augmented the viscosity and electrical conductivity of all the hybrid alumina–ferrofluids, whereas a rise in temperature enhanced their electrical conductivity and detracted the viscosity. DW-based hybrid alumina–ferrofluid was observed to have a lower viscosity and higher electrical conductivity than the EG–DW-based counterpart. The results showed that the optimum ANN and ANFIS models have a maximum error of less than 4.5% and 3.9% for relative viscosity and electrical conductivity, respectively, which were lower than those proposed using regression analysis.

A robust and effective method of fine particle size characterization is presented. It is based on the core–shell model and the analysis of the dependence of saturation magnetization on particle concentration. A novel advantage method has been used as a straightforward way to determine the concentration dependence of the effective field related to particle interaction that was calculated from the experimentally obtained concentration dependence of low field susceptibility. The computed relationship is compared with the concentration dependences of effective fields derived from several well-known theoretical models. We present some peculiarities of the real part of dynamic magnetic susceptibility on temperature. Investigated features are defined both by the magnetic state of fine particles and by crystallization of carrier at the liquid to a solid phase transition. For the first time, the dependence of the magnetization relaxation time on the colloidal particle concentration and the magnitude of bias DC magnetic field was investigated experimentally. Results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for moderate concentration and significantly differs for concentration greater 7 vol%. It is concluded that this effect can be related either to the enhanced particle interaction or to the transition of some particles from superparamagnetic to a ferromagnetic state.

The interaction of magnetic nanoparticles with magnetic forces and the resulting structural changes in the ferrofluids may tune their dielectric spectra. In this paper, we present an experimental study on the controllability of a dielectric spectrum of Mn-Zn ferrite transformer oil-based ferrofluid by means of a static electric field generated by a direct current (DC) bias voltage. Two experimental configurations of the DC bias voltage are applied. The spectrum of a complex permittivity measured in the frequency range from 1 mHz up to 200 kHz is firstly studied under an internal DC bias voltage applied on the electrodes of a measuring capacitor. Then, the sensitivity of the dielectric spectrum to the external DC bias voltage applied on an external pair of electrodes outside the measuring capacitor is investigated. It is found that the increasing internal DC bias voltage significantly shifts the whole dielectric spectrum to lower frequencies and gives rise to higher permittivity values. The external DC bias voltage is remarkably less capable of such tuning. The obtained dielectric spectra are described by a fitting function composed of Havriliak-Negami and conductivity terms. The fitting parameters are compared in the analysis of the two DC bias voltage effects. An interfacial polarization on the nanoparticles is considered to dominate the dielectric spectrum. The aggregation of nanoparticles due to the induced electric polarization and the acting electric forces is discussed as a primary reason of the changes in the dielectric spectra. The DC bias voltage-tunable dielectric spectrum thus complements the controllability of ferrofluids by external forces and may open a new avenue of research and applications in electrical engineering. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","The paper experimentally studies the controllability of ferrofluids' dielectric spectrum using external electric forces."

The magnetic nanoparticle would undergo various structural transitions under external magnetic field, including chainlike formation and lateral coalescence which, in turn, leads to various interesting light transmission phenomena. It is thus possible to alter the properties of the transmitted light by adjusting the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to that of the incident light.

Particles interaction with their carrying flow or the surrounding tissues still needs to be completely understood, as well as the mechanisms underlying interparticle interactions. These interactions can potentially promote particles aggregation in the fluid doman and therefore influence the therapy outcome. This study presents a numerical model to describe particles magnetohydrodynamics in a realistic setup for magnetic drug targeting. The focus is a quantitative analysis of the contribution of the local ferrofluid concentration gradients to the magnetic fluid volume force, as well as an investigation on the dependence of the magnetic fluid volume force on particles diameter and ferrofluid concentration. The results show that the main contribution to the magnetic fluid volume force is the magnetic field gradients term. However, the concentration gradients term ranges in the same order of magnitude and therefore cannot be neglected in the force formulation. In addition, the molar concentration distribution has been found to change with different force formulations and with different values of the molar influx too. The model outlines that the magnetic fluid volume force increases with the particle diameter and the ferrofluid concentration. However, both relationships are not linear, but more complex. The described approach proves to be versatile and further applicable to more complex geometries and scenarios. In addition, the outcome and the achievements of the presented numerical model provide for the first time insights into the role of the local ferrofluid concentration gradients in the determination of the magnetic fluid volume force and represent a starting point for further investigations of the mechanisms underlying the flow-mediated ferrofluid mass transport. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","The paper presents a numerical model to investigate the influence of local particle concentration gradient forces on flow-mediated mass transport in magnetic drug targeting."

Together with X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray emission spectroscopy, we confirm that the degree of cation inversion is altered by thermal annealing. We can correlate the magnetic properties with both the nanosize influence and the degree of inversion.

This paper presents a revised mixed lubrication model that accounts for magnetic field circumstances. Considering Gaussian random roughness, time-varying effect, and thermal effect, the lubrication equations are numerically calculated. First, four start-up modes are evaluated and compared; then the differences between ferrofluids and base oil are quantitatively studied. Furthermore, the influences of ferromagnetic particle size and magnetic field intensity on the film formation and wear of rough elliptical contact are discussed. Results show that ferrofluid lubrication is of great significance in wear reduction compared with base oil.

It was shown that with a shaft radius of up to 50 mm and speed up to 3000 rpm, the change in the retained pressure drop was insignificant, and it was up to 2 % of the values with a stationary shaft. Significant manifestation of centrifugal force for the investigated shaft radii began at 6000 rpm. It was shown that the decrease in the retained pressure drop with an increase in the working gap was associated with the decrease in the magnetic field gradient. The significance of the results consisted in the possibility of using the developed model for the study of the ferrofluid sealer gap processes. Comparison with the data obtained using the analytical formulas showed that the latter overestimated the retained pressure drop. © Nesterov S., Stradomskiy Yu., Belov V., 2021","The paper studies interconnected physical processes in a magnetic fluid sealer using a numerical model."

Using appropriate similarity variables, the governing partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations before being solved numerically by a shooting method with Maple implementation. The variations of the numerical solutions for the skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number, as well as the velocity and temperature profiles are obtained for pertinent parameters by considering two types of base fluids (water and kerosene) with three selected ferroparticles (magnetite, cobalt ferrite and manganese-zinc ferrite). It is found that triple solutions exist for both assisting and opposing flows. Also, the kerosene-based magnetite provides the highest heat transfer rate compared to the other two ferroparticles. The stability analysis is then carried out to test the stability of the non-uniqueness solutions by applying bvp4c solver in Matlab. Results from the stability analysis revealed that the first solution is stable and physically realizable while the second and third solutions are unstable and not physically realizable. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","The paper performs a stability analysis of MHD mixed convection flow and heat transfer over a moving flat plate in ferrofluids."

This study aims to synthesize ferrofluids (FF)-Chitosan-Au (so-called cold synthesis) as the initial step before using198 Au that is expected to be a targeted and controllable brachytherapy agent. In this research, the preparation of FF-Chitosan was done by the co-precipitation method. Furthermore, FF-Chitosan-Au was produced via self-assembly by the adsorption method. The adsorption followed the Langmuir model with a maximum capacity of 30.24 mg Au/g FF-Chitosan. The X-Ray Diffractometion (XRD) of FF-Chitosan-Au confirms the existence of Au. Particle Size Analyzer (PSA) indicates FF-Chitosan-Au has an average size of 82.93 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.175. Morphological and distribution analysis of nanoparticles using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) shows that nanoparticles have a homogenous spherical shape. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) measurement confirms the superparamagnetic properties of FF-Chitosan and FF-Chitosan-Au with a saturated magnetization of 80.48 and 74.52 emu/g, respectively. The overall results are associated with biomedical requirements, such as high saturation magnetization and good polydispersity. The synthesis can also be applied to produce FF-Chitosan-198 Au that has great potential as a brachytherapy agent, which will reduce the nuclear waste and potential danger of radiation received by workers during synthesis. © 2021, Gadjah Mada University.
