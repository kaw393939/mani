In response to the field, the ferrofluid forms fanciful sculptures as determined by the magnetic field lines. In one embodiment, a low viscosity and surface tension ferrofluid is used in a sealed housing to prevent the ferrofluid from evaporating. The housing is filled with a nonmagnetic liquid that is immiscible with the ferrofluid and contains a ferrofluid globule. In order to prevent the ferrofluid from wetting the inside surface of the housing and degrading the apparatus, the housing is comprised of a boro-silicate glass and the ferrofluid comprises a fluorocarbon carrier liquid. Magnetic sculptures can be formed by applying an external magnetic field of sufficient strength to the apparatus. In another embodiment, the aforementioned apparatus may contain a small permanent magnetic located within the ferrofluid globule. In still another alternative embodiment, magnetic sculptures are formed in the open air by using apparatus which comprises an object for receiving a ferrofluid and a mechanism for generating a magnetic field to shape the ferrofluid. The mechanism may include a magnet which generates shaped fields, a shaped magnet or a shaped magnetically permeable pole piece and a magnet. The ferrofluid is a hydrocarbon-based fluid that does not evaporate rapidly so that the sculpture is stable, but the viscosity of the ferrofluid is low enough that the ferrofluid forms intricate designs based on the magnetic field used to shape the ferrofluid. A wax ferrofluid can also be used to create artistic patterns by shaped magnetic fields in the same manner as standard ferrofluid. The advantage of wax is that it can be painted to enhance visual effects. No magnet is needed to maintain the shape of the sculpture after the wax solidifies.",FERROFLUIDICS CORP,RAJ KULDIP;;LENNON JOHN,FERROFLUIDCS CORPORATION (1999-05-04),https://lens.org/060-433-649-113-318,Granted Patent,yes,2,39,1,060-433-649-113-318,US,1,060-433-649-113-318,US,0,H01F1/44;;G09B23/181;;H01F1/44;;G09B23/181,G09B23/18;;H01F1/44,264/405;;264/427,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The reservoir is located between seal stages and contains a quantity of ferrofluid sufficient to replace ferrofluid in the seal stages which is lost due to evaporation or contamination. The seal is designed to withstand a pressure drop between a high pressure area and a low pressure area and the location of the reservoir is selected so that the pressure capacity of the seal stages between the low pressure area and the reservoir is sufficient to withstand the entire pressure drop. The pressure capacity of the seal stages between the high pressure area and the reservoir is less than the entire pressure drop. Failure of the seal stages between the reservoir and low pressure area causes failure of the seal stages between the reservoir and the high pressure area. The total failure of all of the seal stages allows fluid to flow through the seal which fluid sweeps ferrofluid from the reservoir into the seal stages between the reservoir and low pressure area. This latter ferrofluid replenishes the ferrofluid in the failed seal stages and restores pressure capacity of the seal.

As the fluid approaches the device its temperature rises, resulting in loss of magnetic properties and a decrease in density. The ferrofluid rises as its temperature approaches the Curie point, since the gravitational effect of density reduction begins to overcome the weakening magnetic attraction. Movement of hot ferrofluid is strongly assisted by the attraction exerted by the device on cooler, more intensely magnetic ferrofluid, which displaces the hot ferrofluid. The displaced ferrofluid cools as a result of movement from the heat source and through contact with the walls of the housing.

The ferrofluid slug is contained in a tube and moves within the tapered magnetic field, which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tube. The field has a maximum flux density at its center and tapers off in both axial directions from its center. In response to a pressure differential of zero, the slug is centered in the field. In response to a non-zero pressure differential, the slug moves to the position in the field where the net magnetic forces equal the pressure differential. The position of the slug is sensed by sensing elements which produce output signals that vary according to the position of the slug. In a preferred embodiment the sensing elements are pickup coils that are positioned to encompass the range of movement of one end of the slug, or are a pair of pickup coils positioned, respectively, to encompass the range of movement of the two ends of the slug. The ferrofluid slug thus acts as a movable core for the pickup coil(s). As the ferrofluid slug moves, it changes the relative inductances of the pickup coils. The one coil or the pair of coils are connected in a bridge circuit, which produces an output signal that varies according to the changing inductances, and thus, the pressure differential.",FERROFLUIDICS CORP,RAJ KULDIP;;MOSKOWITZ RONALD,FERROFLUIDICS CORPORATION (1993-12-13),https://lens.org/107-005-362-678-234,Granted Patent,yes,11,17,1,107-005-362-678-234,US,1,107-005-362-678-234,US,0,H01F21/06;;C23C14/08;;G01L9/0094;;H01F1/447;;H01F21/06;;C23C14/08;;G01L9/0094;;H01F1/447,G01L9/00,73/749;;73/728,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

As a sealant, the ferrofluid acts to exclude particulate matter from passing through the seal area contaminating internal mechanism elements, while as a lubricant, the ferrofluid forms a film between the shaft and the elastomer-material seal element; thus, cooling and lubricating the contact interface and acting to extend the life of the related components. The seal assembly has permanent magnetic elements which create a magnetic-field gradient, causing magnetic-field maxima at points immediately surrounding the contact point between the seal-elastomer material and the shaft. The ferrofluid is entrained magnetically within the interface region; thus, insuring continual lubrication of the contacting surfaces, while further, the entraining forces prevent leakage of the ferrofluid from the region.",FERROFLUIDICS CORP,MOSKOWITZ RONALD;;REED WALTER R;;STAHL PHILIP,,https://lens.org/100-210-842-210-436,Granted Patent,yes,4,85,1,100-210-842-210-436,US,1,100-210-842-210-436,US,0,F16J15/324;;F16J15/43;;F16N15/00;;F16J15/324;;F16J15/43;;F16N15/00,F16J15/32;;F16J15/43;;F16N15/00,277/80,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The pressure sensor is U-shaped with a first one leg connected, via a first pressure chamber, to a bubbler tube that extends downwardly into the storage tank. The second leg of the U-shaped sensor connects to a second pressure chamber, which applies to the second leg a selected, fixed pressure. The pressure applied to the first leg of the sensor is proportional to the hydrostatic back pressure in the bubbler tube, which varies directly with the level of liquid in the storage tank. Wound around the legs of the pressure sensor are inductance coils. The inductances of these coils change as the ferrofluid sensing element moves within the sensor. Accordingly, the inductances change as the level of liquid in the storage tank varies. The inductor coils are connected to a control system which produces a control signal based on the differences of the inductances. This control signal thus varies essentially continuously with changes in the level of liquid in the storage tank. The control signal is preferably used to control a storage tank control system which includes various pumps. In response to the control signal, the pumps force liquid into or out of the storage tank, as appropriate. Alternatively, an array of sensing elements may be used to determine the position of the ferrofluid. Signals from the various sensing elements in the array are essentially encoded to produce an output signal that corresponds to the level of fluid in the storage tank.",FERROFLUIDICS CORP,RAJ KULDIP;;GREYSON JAY;;IONESCU CHRISTIAN,FERROFLUIDICS CORPORATION (1996-10-25),https://lens.org/113-059-697-038-790,Granted Patent,yes,17,16,1,113-059-697-038-790,US,1,113-059-697-038-790,US,0,G01L9/0094;;G01F23/162;;G01F23/168;;G01L9/0094;;G01F23/162;;G01F23/168,G01F23/16;;G01L9/00,73/299;;73/749,1,0,,,"Lathi, B.P.; Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems (New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston); pp. 214 216.

Placing a workpiece in the vessel so that the workpiece is submerged in the ferrofluid finishing material. A magnetic field is then applied in the vicinity of the vessel. The magnetic field produces an increase in viscosity of the ferrofluid. The increased viscosity generates a clamping force on the workpiece that results in increased surface resistance over the entire workpiece. Also, as the viscosity increases, it forces the workpiece to move relative to the ferrofluid. The relative motion between the abrasive media and the workpiece and increased surface resistance causes the abrasive media to finish the surface of the workpiece.

The shields have a closely-spaced, noncontacting relationship with the inner race thereby defining gaps. The elements of the bearing are of magnetically permeable material, and the sealed bearing includes means for producing a magnetic field in the gaps and in the regions where the rolling elements contact the races. A ferrofluid is retained by the magnetic field in the gaps for sealing and in the regions of contact between the rolling elements and the races for lubrication. A reservoir of ferrofluid in the regions between the two seals replenishes ferrofluid lost at the sealing and lubrication areas.

In the disk drive system, there is a plurality of critically spaced magnetic disks rotated by a disk motor. A spindle shaft, which is retained by the spindle sleeve, couples to the disk motor and to the plurality of magnetic disks for rotation. The spindle shaft and spindle sleeve uses a bearing, which is lubricated by a non-ferrofluid conductive lubricant. The lubricant is used to prevent electrostatic charge build up during operation of the disk drive system. The lubricant may be either a non-polar oil or a ball bearing grease and further having either a metal caged fullerenes compound, STADIS-450, ASA-3, or Polyfloe 130. One particular type of lubricant is an emeraldine salt of polyanilin produced according to the steps of first reacting a solution of HCL and ammonium persulfate into a solution of HCL and analine to form a polymer. Next, the polymer is mixed with ammonium hydroxide and then is prepared to have a molecular weight of 1,000-20,000.

In addition, a diaphragm of an electro-dynamic loudspeaker is provided with a short turn of conductor disposed along a fringe zone at an edge of the diaphragm in order to electro-dynamically dampen the edge resonance of the film.",STEERE JOHN F;;GARNER DAVID B;;HUTT STEVEN W,STEERE JOHN F;;GARNER DAVID B;;HUTT STEVEN W,,https://lens.org/180-255-940-790-834,Patent Application,yes,15,9,4,053-358-913-696-305;;106-054-914-848-348;;058-654-775-986-547;;180-255-940-790-834,US,60,028-360-020-902-85X;;161-708-998-647-619;;077-257-301-645-986;;071-802-396-913-041;;051-983-626-494-330;;066-047-707-956-747;;007-586-888-630-596;;128-298-164-089-467;;161-461-947-666-711;;138-899-195-866-974;;137-605-100-259-029;;195-742-717-080-293;;161-710-624-243-874;;084-089-176-779-793;;100-058-750-971-584;;014-334-740-946-095;;058-654-775-986-547;;180-255-940-790-834;;120-491-259-658-187;;199-672-656-607-833;;111-622-603-318-060;;171-485-255-792-337;;103-261-286-259-317;;183-356-584-383-440;;184-435-877-086-185;;093-806-243-121-429;;096-026-290-957-490;;044-385-412-906-463;;180-969-973-683-765;;158-392-365-637-721;;195-140-016-745-223;;153-889-118-631-295;;099-699-964-873-185;;072-471-180-151-095;;053-358-913-696-305;;197-450-929-456-158;;007-960-346-730-258;;072-442-363-237-809;;117-385-937-143-944;;058-119-309-243-055;;072-702-643-037-682;;012-672-391-807-749;;009-218-808-794-368;;096-898-220-600-419;;186-561-774-008-125;;049-515-864-530-553;;002-001-358-425-351;;087-553-749-241-460;;070-390-232-702-796;;106-054-914-848-348;;133-850-427-888-947;;054-122-934-965-557;;011-812-382-613-18X;;163-997-407-097-907;;027-225-274-753-569;;058-844-976-648-613;;196-964-282-811-877;;010-577-639-035-597;;037-320-257-294-901;;136-987-328-069-512,EP;;US;;AU;;CN;;KR;;JP;;WO,0,H04R9/047;;B60R11/0205;;B60R11/0211;;B60R11/0217;;B60R11/0223;;B60R11/0235;;B60R2011/0003;;B60R2011/0017;;B60R2011/0028;;B60R2011/0082;;B60R2011/0094;;B60R2011/0288;;H04R1/025;;H04R1/026;;H04R1/06;;H04R7/04;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/06;;H04R31/003;;H04R31/006;;H04R2201/34;;H04R2400/11;;H04R2499/13;;H04R9/047;;B60R11/0205;;B60R11/0211;;B60R11/0217;;B60R11/0223;;B60R11/0235;;B60R2011/0003;;B60R2011/0017;;B60R2011/0028;;B60R2011/0082;;B60R2011/0094;;B60R2011/0288;;H04R1/025;;H04R1/026;;H04R1/06;;H04R7/04;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/06;;H04R31/003;;H04R31/006;;H04R2201/34;;H04R2400/11;;H04R2499/13,B60R11/00;;B60R11/02;;H04R1/02;;H04R1/06;;H04R5/02;;H04R7/04;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/00;;H04R9/02;;H04R9/04;;H04R9/06;;H04R11/02;;H04R31/00,381/431;;381/423,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The drive fluid is preferably a ferrofluid, and the force field is preferably a variable magnetic field. Drive fluid, driven by variation of the magnetic field, drives driven fluid through the channel. The drive fluid is recirculated, in one case by rotating the drive fluid within an enlargement in the channel, and in another case by returning the drive fluid along a return channel. A valve is formed by using a ferrofluid plug as a movable barrier for fluids in a channel. The microfluid device may be formed between two plates forming a microchip. The channels may be as small as 1 mum to 100 mum. Methods of pumping fluids by using an in channel drive fluid and exterior drive are also disclosed.",MICRALYNE INC,BACKHOUSE CHRIS J,MICRALYNE INC.

The volume of the reservoir is relatively large compared to the volumes of the interstage areas between the other seal stages. In addition, a controlled leakage path bypasses the first stage from the reservoir to the low-pressure area. The leakage rate through the bypass path is controlled so that gas in the reservoir leaks to the low-pressure area relatively slowly, for example, the bypass path might equalize the pressure across the first stage over a five-minute interval. This arrangement prevents a seal stage burst from disgorging a large gas volume into the low-pressure side.",FERROTEC USA CORP,LI ZHIXIN,FERROTEC USA CORP (2002-07-09),https://lens.org/151-810-075-600-87X,Granted Patent,yes,7,8,1,151-810-075-600-87X,US,1,151-810-075-600-87X,US,0,F16J15/43;;F16J15/004;;F16J15/006;;F16J15/43;;F16J15/004;;F16J15/006,F16J15/00;;F16J15/43,277/410;;277/411,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A plurality of radially extending circumferential teeth are concentrically arrayed around the periphery of the rotating shaft in parallel relationship to the Vee-shaped circumferential portion on the rotating shaft on at least one of its sides and spaced closely adjacent thereto. The housing has a complementary generally Vee-shaped cross section within which the Vee-shaped circumferential portion of the rotating shaft rides and in conjunction with the Vee-shaped cross section portion defines a space within which the concentrically arrayed circumferential teeth extend. A magnetically susceptible ferrofluid is disposed within this space for forming a centrifugal seal during high speed rotation of the shaft and the ferrofluid communicates with the gaps formed between the ends of the concentrically arrayed circumferential teeth and the opposite surfaces of the rotating shaft on each side of the Vee-shaped cross section circumferential teeth. A magnetic field is impressed across the gaps thus defined to form a plurality of magnetic seal stages with the shaft at standstill and at low rotating speeds.,MECHANICAL TECH INC,PINKUS OSCAR;;WILCOCK DONALD F,MECHANICAL TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED (1982-12-06),https://lens.org/110-917-373-952-956,Granted Patent,yes,6,38,1,110-917-373-952-956,US,1,110-917-373-952-956,US,0,F16J15/43;;F16J15/42;;F16J15/43;;F16J15/42,F16J15/42;;F16J15/43,277/1;;277/13;;277/80,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The magnets have a critical angle of displacement from a horizontal static position of less than 1 degree, with at least some of the magnets having mutually different properties. With different magnetic strengths, a greater movement is produced for both magnets in response to movements of the support structure, for particular ranges of magnetic strength ratios, than would be the case with equal magnets. The magnet movement can be translated into an electrical signal to power an operating system.

Thereby, a magnetofluid with a saturation magnetization of 150 to 450 mT has been used with an initial permeability of 5 to 25.",HAEHNDEL; THOMAS;;STAHLMANN; HANNS-DIETRICH;;NETHE; ARNIM;;MUELLER; JOHANNES;;BUSKE; NORBERT;;REHFELD; ARMIN,HAEHNDEL THOMAS;;STAHLMANN HANNS-DIETRICH;;NETHE ARNIM;;MUELLER JOHANNES;;BUSKE NORBERT;;REHFELD ARMIN,,https://lens.org/077-528-172-795-751,Granted Patent,yes,8,19,13,037-819-964-388-985;;146-339-819-574-625;;029-561-244-324-873;;058-920-728-186-28X;;000-847-779-209-020;;161-993-920-435-275;;045-002-494-578-664;;166-062-519-978-595;;077-528-172-795-751;;075-859-433-885-696;;090-254-216-566-850;;019-631-357-128-105;;025-719-637-451-12X,BR;;EP;;DE;;EA;;US;;HU;;AU;;JP;;WO;;CA,20,013-813-783-265-363;;037-819-964-388-985;;121-545-205-583-949;;146-339-819-574-625;;029-561-244-324-873;;058-920-728-186-28X;;000-847-779-209-020;;161-993-920-435-275;;055-615-387-369-992;;045-002-494-578-664;;166-062-519-978-595;;077-528-172-795-751;;075-859-433-885-696;;025-719-637-451-12X;;123-530-709-840-786;;090-254-216-566-850;;019-631-357-128-105;;106-117-917-445-355;;154-797-406-251-738;;065-784-895-657-667,BR;;EP;;DE;;EA;;US;;HU;;AU;;JP;;WO;;CA,0,H01F1/442;;A61M60/892;;A61M60/148;;A61M60/427;;A61M60/178;;A61M60/196;;H01F1/442;;A61M60/148;;A61M60/892;;A61M60/196;;A61M60/427;;A61M60/178,A61M60/178;;A61M60/196;;F04B43/08;;A61M60/268;;A61M60/427;;A61M60/857;;H01F1/44,604/151;;623/3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

At standstill or low-speed the magnetic fluid is retained by magnetic force in the close-clearance magnetic gap region formed by several sets of opposing pole-like teeth confronting the inner surfaces of the rotating disk-like collar/vane. By virtue of magnetic attraction the magnetic fluid can withstand a pressure drop between high and low pressure regions and thus effects a magnetic seal at standstill and low speeds. As the shaft rotates faster, the magnetic fluid is forced centrifugally from the magnetic seal region and becomes a rotating mass or pool of fluid at the circumferential rim of the disk-like collar/vane.

The displacement alters the normal magnetic field pattern to create a substantially uniform magnetic field throughout the pole piece/shaft interface region such that ferrofluid can be drawn through the region. When the shaft is returned to its original position with respect to the pole piece/magnet assembly, that is, when the pole piece projections are re-aligned axially with the shaft projections, a series of stages of the multi-stage hermetic ""O-ring"" seal are created. An alternative embodiment of the invention uses the capillary action of the liquid to maintain a multistage seal which holds the liquid in place using axially aligned wettable and non-wettable surfaces on a shaft and stator surrounding the shaft. With the wettable surfaces of the shaft axially aligned with those of the stator, the liquid congregates in the gaps formed between the wettable surfaces of the shaft and stator. Filling of the seal is accomplished by displacing the shaft relative to the stator such that each wettable surface on the shaft axially overlaps two wettable surfaces on the stator, thus providing a path of wettable surfaces which allow the liquid to flow along the length of the seal.",FERROFLUIDICS CORP,BLACK JR THOMAS J;;MRAZ WILLIAM B,FERROFLUDICS CORPORATION (1997-01-20),https://lens.org/109-751-289-058-641,Granted Patent,yes,48,8,1,109-751-289-058-641,US,3,182-473-383-511-692;;034-086-367-866-243;;109-751-289-058-641,US,0,F16J15/43;;F16J15/43,F16J15/43,277/1;;277/80,3,1,073-208-402-299-166,10.1080/05698198508981593,"J.

In the disk drive system, there is a plurality of critically spaced magnetic disks rotated by a disk motor. A spindle shaft, which is retained by the spindle sleeve, couples to the disk motor and to the plurality of magnetic disks for rotation. The spindle shaft and spindle sleeve uses a bearing, which is lubricated by a non-ferrofluid conductive lubricant. The lubricant is used to prevent electrostatic charge build up during operation of the disk drive system. The lubricant may be either a non-polar oil or a ball bearing grease and further comprising either a metal caged fullerenes compound, STADIS-450, ASA-3, or Polyfloe 130. One particular type of lubricant is an emeraldine salt of polyanilin produced according to the steps of first reacting a solution of HCL and ammonium persulfate into a solution of HCL and analine to form a polymer. Next, the polymer is mixed with ammonium hydroxide and then is prepared to have a molecular weight of 1,000-20,000.

These materials should also prove useful in other fields where ferrofluids and other magnetic liquids have found use when the plastic mechanical properties of the gel are not a limitation. The novel invention produces a magnetic material that exhibits the soft, thixotropic properties of play gels. A gelatinous material such as a silicone gel has a fine magnetic powder dispersed throughout by kneading into a substantially uniform mixture at ambient/room temperature. The advantage of this method for producing magnetic gel over the alternative of adding a gelling agent to an existing ferrofluid are simplicity and the ability to choose the properties of the gelatinous material independently of the need for a carrier fluid. Various types of toy applications include resilient plastic covered forms, template action figure body forms, flowers, and volcanoes with various shaped openings.

The spaced apart magnet arrays are juxtaposed with each magnet in one array attractively interacting with the corresponding magnet in the other array across a small gap. The magnetic flux across the gap is further enhanced by having adjacent magnets in each array having alternate magnetic orientation and by providing a magnetic yoke of magnetically permeable material for the magnet ends of each array that do not face the gap. The gap is provided to allow a conductor in the form of a coil fit between the magnets. Relative motion between the coil and the magnets results in maximal generation of electrical power by the coil.,CHEUNG JEFFREY T;;TOMSIC RICHARD R,CHEUNG JEFFREY T;;TOMSIC RICHARD R,TELEDYNE SCIENTIFIC & IMAGING LLC (2011-12-21);;CIIIS LLC (2006-03-06);;TELEDYNE LICENSING LLC (2006-09-18),https://lens.org/161-853-469-656-211,Patent Application,yes,8,68,10,169-228-977-330-194;;074-879-692-303-701;;119-944-423-760-153;;161-853-469-656-211;;056-584-385-928-444;;041-283-132-224-226;;114-512-017-215-722;;182-741-698-774-057;;129-303-838-033-006;;090-792-869-635-110,EP;;TW;;US;;KR;;JP;;CN;;WO,10,169-228-977-330-194;;074-879-692-303-701;;119-944-423-760-153;;161-853-469-656-211;;056-584-385-928-444;;041-283-132-224-226;;114-512-017-215-722;;182-741-698-774-057;;129-303-838-033-006;;090-792-869-635-110,EP;;TW;;US;;KR;;JP;;CN;;WO,0,H02K41/0356;;B82Y25/00;;H01F1/0045;;H01F1/14708;;H01F1/37;;H01F7/0221;;H01F7/0289;;H02K1/02;;H02K3/30;;H02K5/167;;H02K21/24;;H02K35/04;;H02K41/00;;B82Y40/00;;H02K41/0356;;B82Y25/00;;H01F1/0045;;H01F1/14708;;H01F1/37;;H01F7/0221;;H01F7/0289;;H02K1/02;;H02K3/30;;H02K5/167;;H02K21/24;;H02K35/04,H02K41/00,310/12,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The method comprises combining the liquid medium containing the substance with magnetic particles under conditions for non-specific chemical binding of the magnetic particles. Thereafter, the medium is subjected to a magnetic field gradient to separate the particles from the medium. The preferred non-specific binding is achieved as the result of charge interactions between the particles usually by means of a polyionic reagent. The method of the invention has particular application to the separation of cells and microorganisms from aqueous suspensions and also to the determination of an analyte in a sample suspected of containing the analyte. The analyte is a member of a specific binding pair (sbp). The sample is combined in an assay medium with magnetic particles and a sbp member complementary to the analyte. Magnetic or non-magnetic particles capable of specific binding to the analyte or its complementary sbp member must be included in the assay medium. The combination is made under conditions for non-specifically aggregating the magnetic particles or coaggregating the magnetic and non-magnetic particles when non-magnetic particles are present. The assay medium is subjected to a magnetic field gradient to separate the aggregated particles from the medium. Then, the medium or the particles are examined for the presence or amount of the analyte or an sbp member, the binding of which is affected by the presence of the analyte.",BEHRINGWERKE AG,ULLMAN EDWIN F;;GHAZAROSSIAN VARTAN E;;KURN NURITH;;WENG LITAI,DADE BEHRING MARBURG GMBH (1997-07-21);;BEHRINGWERKE AG (1995-07-28),https://lens.org/025-043-243-006-667,Granted Patent,yes,26,85,2,012-460-060-507-448;;025-043-243-006-667,US,13,008-529-374-810-704;;059-755-904-154-843;;118-608-720-134-758;;134-865-110-752-556;;005-209-305-355-769;;022-717-125-358-425;;073-616-204-033-650;;047-472-143-642-82X;;197-112-167-595-300;;128-630-269-500-218;;025-043-243-006-667;;076-725-995-590-999;;012-460-060-507-448,AT;;EP;;DE;;US;;AU;;JP;;ES;;CA,0,C12Q1/24;;B03C1/01;;G01N33/538;;G01N33/54333;;Y10S436/829;;C12Q1/24;;B03C1/01;;G01N33/538;;G01N33/54333,B03C1/01;;C12Q1/24;;G01N33/538;;G01N33/543,435/7.25;;435/7.92;;435/7.93;;435/7.94;;435/261;;436/520;;436/526;;436/529;;436/534;;436/829;;209/5;;209/214;;210/222;;210/695;;210/704;;210/705;;210/710,1,1,049-734-125-292-563,24234227;;10.1007/bf02798294,"Hirschbein et al., Applied Biochemistry & Biotechnology, 7, 157 176 (1981).",EXPIRED

In addition, a diaphragm of an electro-dynamic loudspeaker is provided with a short turn of conductor disposed along a fringe zone at an edge of the diaphragm in order to electro-dynamically dampen the edge resonance of the film.",STEERE JOHN F;;GARNER DAVID B;;HUTT STEVEN W,STEERE JOHN F;;GARNER DAVID B;;HUTT STEVEN W,,https://lens.org/106-054-914-848-348,Patent Application,yes,12,5,4,053-358-913-696-305;;106-054-914-848-348;;058-654-775-986-547;;180-255-940-790-834,US,60,028-360-020-902-85X;;161-708-998-647-619;;077-257-301-645-986;;071-802-396-913-041;;051-983-626-494-330;;066-047-707-956-747;;007-586-888-630-596;;128-298-164-089-467;;161-461-947-666-711;;138-899-195-866-974;;137-605-100-259-029;;195-742-717-080-293;;161-710-624-243-874;;084-089-176-779-793;;100-058-750-971-584;;014-334-740-946-095;;058-654-775-986-547;;180-255-940-790-834;;120-491-259-658-187;;199-672-656-607-833;;111-622-603-318-060;;171-485-255-792-337;;103-261-286-259-317;;183-356-584-383-440;;184-435-877-086-185;;093-806-243-121-429;;096-026-290-957-490;;044-385-412-906-463;;180-969-973-683-765;;158-392-365-637-721;;195-140-016-745-223;;153-889-118-631-295;;099-699-964-873-185;;072-471-180-151-095;;053-358-913-696-305;;197-450-929-456-158;;007-960-346-730-258;;072-442-363-237-809;;117-385-937-143-944;;058-119-309-243-055;;072-702-643-037-682;;012-672-391-807-749;;009-218-808-794-368;;096-898-220-600-419;;186-561-774-008-125;;049-515-864-530-553;;002-001-358-425-351;;087-553-749-241-460;;070-390-232-702-796;;106-054-914-848-348;;133-850-427-888-947;;054-122-934-965-557;;011-812-382-613-18X;;163-997-407-097-907;;027-225-274-753-569;;058-844-976-648-613;;196-964-282-811-877;;010-577-639-035-597;;037-320-257-294-901;;136-987-328-069-512,EP;;US;;AU;;CN;;KR;;JP;;WO,0,H04R9/047;;B60R11/0205;;B60R11/0211;;B60R11/0217;;B60R11/0223;;B60R11/0235;;B60R2011/0003;;B60R2011/0017;;B60R2011/0028;;B60R2011/0082;;B60R2011/0094;;B60R2011/0288;;H04R1/025;;H04R1/026;;H04R1/06;;H04R7/04;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/06;;H04R31/003;;H04R31/006;;H04R2201/34;;H04R2400/11;;H04R2499/13;;H04R9/047;;B60R11/0205;;B60R11/0211;;B60R11/0217;;B60R11/0223;;B60R11/0235;;B60R2011/0003;;B60R2011/0017;;B60R2011/0028;;B60R2011/0082;;B60R2011/0094;;B60R2011/0288;;H04R1/025;;H04R1/026;;H04R1/06;;H04R7/04;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/06;;H04R31/003;;H04R31/006;;H04R2201/34;;H04R2400/11;;H04R2499/13,B60R11/00;;B60R11/02;;H04R1/02;;H04R1/06;;H04R5/02;;H04R7/04;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/00;;H04R9/02;;H04R9/04;;H04R9/06;;H04R11/02;;H04R31/00,381/431;;381/398;;381/391;;381/396,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The interposition of unselected droplets between selected droplets prevents undesired magnetic interactions between selected droplets and gives them optimum spacing before they are deposited upon the recording surface, while at the same time keeping all of the droplets in sufficiently close proximity to give the stream aerodynamic stability. The gutter or catcher for unselected droplets is located between the second axial deflector (X deflector) and the recording surface. The magnetic field of the second deflector is specially shaped so that it can effectively control the trajectories of all selected droplets that have passed through the field of the first axial deflector (Y deflector), but without affecting the trajectories of unselected droplets aimed at the gutter. The selected and unselected droplets form separate substreams which have sufficient angular divergence in the X direction for enabling the unselected droplets to be guttered without excessively spreading their individual trajectories along that axis, since they are not affected by the X deflecting field, but the divergence is not great enough to disrupt the aerodynamic stabilizing action of each substream upon the other.",IBM,FAN GEORGE JEE;;LO DAVID CHAN-WAI;;MITCHELL JOSEPH WILLIAM,IBM INFORMATION PRODUCTS CORPORATION 55 RAILROAD AVENUE GREENWICH CT 06830 A CORP OF DE (1991-03-26),https://lens.org/004-667-111-886-838,Granted Patent,yes,3,10,9,163-934-890-524-543;;143-028-536-741-932;;034-900-386-527-013;;004-667-111-886-838;;005-231-650-594-905;;183-180-596-321-507;;149-405-041-051-939;;196-465-293-437-845;;107-828-098-667-057,GB;;IT;;DE;;US;;JP;;FR;;CA,9,163-934-890-524-543;;143-028-536-741-932;;034-900-386-527-013;;004-667-111-886-838;;005-231-650-594-905;;183-180-596-321-507;;149-405-041-051-939;;196-465-293-437-845;;107-828-098-667-057,GB;;IT;;DE;;US;;JP;;FR;;CA,0,B41J2/035;;G01D15/18;;B41J2/035;;G01D15/18,B41J2/095;;B41J2/035;;G01D15/18,346/75,2,0,,,"Fan, et al., Magnetic Deflector for MIJ Printing, IBM Tech.

The yoke is designed such that is constitutes a housing or a cabinet of the sound generator. The permanent magnet and the pole pieces are provided in a recess in the cabinet or the yoke and surrounded by the coil, which is connected to the diaphragm at a peripheral area thereof. The diaphragm is provided above the magnet system of the recess and fastened to the outside of the cabinet. The dynamic response of the sound generator is determined by the magnetic, electrical, mechanical, and acoustic parameters which are used in the design of the sound generator. By varying some of these parameters, the frequency and amplitude of a resonance may be chosen such that the sound generator may reconstruct the natural acoustic transfer function in the range of 2-4 kHz in the human meatus. This makes the sound generator particularly suitable for use in hearing aids.",NHA AS,SOGN BJORN;;KROKSTAD ASBJORN;;SVEAN JARLE,NHA A/S A CORP.

Due to fringing effects produced by the selector when unwanted drops are selected, adjacent print drops are deflected a lesser amount from the initial stream trajectory. Print drops not affected by the fringe magnetic field produced to select unwanted drops are subjected to a compensation deflection depending on their position relative to the unwanted drops so that all print drops follow the same trajectory, after passing the magnetic selector in their travel through a vertical deflector and deposition onto the print medium.",IBM,GALETTO LOUIS VALENTINE;;JENSEN DONALD FREDERICK,IBM INFORMATION PRODUCTS CORPORATION 55 RAILROAD AVENUE GREENWICH CT 06830 A CORP OF DE (1991-03-26),https://lens.org/076-735-422-316-879,Granted Patent,yes,5,5,11,168-979-303-213-566;;110-404-787-346-776;;102-191-640-071-679;;071-034-859-462-373;;076-735-422-316-879;;123-525-065-485-97X;;124-000-593-893-410;;019-101-439-842-03X;;199-925-191-939-40X;;196-785-486-518-871;;035-150-567-106-740,BR;;GB;;IT;;DE;;US;;JP;;FR;;CA,11,168-979-303-213-566;;196-785-486-518-871;;102-191-640-071-679;;071-034-859-462-373;;076-735-422-316-879;;124-000-593-893-410;;199-925-191-939-40X;;019-101-439-842-03X;;123-525-065-485-97X;;035-150-567-106-740;;110-404-787-346-776,BR;;GB;;IT;;DE;;US;;JP;;FR;;CA,0,B41J2/10;;B41J2/035;;B41J2/10;;B41J2/035,B41J2/08;;B41J2/035;;B41J2/10,346/75,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

For many applications the cost, size and complexity of the instruments prevents wider use, for example, CD4 analysis in HIV monitoring in resource-poor countries. The novel device, methods and algorithms disclosed herein largely overcome these limitations. Briefly, all cells in a biological sample are fluorescently labeled, but only the target cells are also magnetically labeled. The labeled sample, in a chamber or cuvet, is placed between two wedge-shaped magnets to selectively move the magnetically labeled cells to the observation surface of the cuvet. An LED illuminates the cells and a CCD camera captures the images of the fluorescent light emitted by the target cells. Image analysis performed with a novel algorithm provides a count of the cells on the surface that can be related to the target cell concentration of the original sample. The compact cytometer system provides a rugged, affordable and easy-to-use technique, which can be used in remote locations.",TIBBE ARJAN;;GREVE JAN;;GOHEL DHANESH;;DROOG ERIK;;TERSTAPPEN LEON W,TIBBE ARJAN;;GREVE JAN;;GOHEL DHANESH;;DROOG ERIK;;TERSTAPPEN LEON W,VERIDEX LLC (2008-07-31);;UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE (2013-02-20),https://lens.org/077-440-761-537-957,Patent Application,yes,28,148,18,189-691-962-582-858;;164-928-012-897-675;;108-911-857-467-210;;077-440-761-537-957;;135-763-289-916-82X;;081-633-468-359-851;;173-432-774-144-01X;;140-715-241-250-314;;168-401-705-879-116;;134-766-273-294-787;;157-423-843-640-291;;103-685-302-166-014;;174-512-525-546-479;;115-673-161-337-189;;150-501-918-459-275;;183-044-569-168-15X;;108-900-736-927-117;;192-907-192-047-848,ZA;;EP;;US;;AU;;JP;;KR;;WO;;CA,45,189-691-962-582-858;;075-581-366-094-689;;108-911-857-467-210;;164-928-012-897-675;;022-273-281-200-57X;;133-209-284-970-033;;081-633-468-359-851;;126-850-455-638-036;;140-715-241-250-314;;157-423-843-640-291;;134-766-273-294-787;;145-045-814-232-490;;045-465-087-319-623;;135-036-352-085-176;;103-685-302-166-014;;174-512-525-546-479;;059-677-710-378-127;;043-872-495-316-064;;028-372-470-742-951;;139-573-337-136-042;;152-166-383-836-78X;;192-907-192-047-848;;143-392-837-758-552;;135-763-289-916-82X;;184-733-165-349-579;;077-440-761-537-957;;168-974-595-449-868;;168-401-705-879-116;;118-744-679-341-814;;155-407-055-799-864;;173-432-774-144-01X;;066-787-549-319-999;;167-553-626-628-980;;015-979-295-380-293;;007-738-014-898-030;;003-121-945-835-323;;133-109-058-083-323;;048-201-018-686-948;;132-859-421-809-747;;163-424-482-529-601;;125-546-462-199-585;;115-673-161-337-189;;150-501-918-459-275;;183-044-569-168-15X;;108-900-736-927-117,ZA;;HK;;EP;;US;;AU;;KR;;JP;;WO;;CA;;ES,0,G01N33/5094;;G01N33/54333;;G01N2015/1486;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/101666;;G01N2015/016;;G01N15/1433;;G01N33/48;;G01N37/00;;C12Q1/00;;G06V10/94;;G06V10/10;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/101666;;G01N2015/1486;;G01N33/5094;;G01N33/54333;;G01N15/1433;;G01N2015/016,G01N21/64;;G01N33/53;;C12M1/34;;C12Q1/06;;G01N15/00;;G01N15/14;;G01N21/78;;G01N33/543;;G01N33/545,435/7.2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Thereafter, the medium is subjected to a magnetic field gradient to separate the particles from the medium. The preferred non-specific binding is achieved as the result of charge interactions between the particles usually by means of a polyionic reagent. The method of the invention has particular application to the separation of cells and microorganisms from aqueous suspensions and also to the determination of an analyte in a sample suspected of containing the analyte. The analyte is a member of a specific binding pair (sbp). The sample is combined in an assay medium with magnetic particles and a sbp member complementary to the analyte. Magnetic or non-magnetic particles capable of specific binding to the analyte or its complementary sbp member must be included in the assay medium. The combination is made under conditions for non-specifically aggregating the magnetic particles or coaggregating the magnetic and non-magnetic particles when non-magnetic particles are present. The assay medium is subjected to a magnetic field gradient to separate the aggregated particles from the medium.

A mini-optics tracking and focussing system is presented for solar power conversion that ranges from an individual's portable system to solar conversion of electrical power that can be used in large scale power plants for environmentally clean energy. It can be rolled up, transported, and attached to existing man-made, or natural structures. It allows the solar energy conversion system to be low in capital cost and inexpensive to install as it can be attached to existing structures since it does not require the construction of a superstructure of its own. This novel system is uniquely distinct and different from other solar tracking and focussing processes allowing it to be more economical and practical. Furthermore, in its capacity as a power producer, it can be utilized with far greater safety, simplicity, economy, and efficiency in the conversion of solar energy.",DAVIDSON MARK;;RABINOWITZ MARIO,DAVIDSON MARK;;RABINOWITZ MARIO,,https://lens.org/045-111-918-441-024,Patent Application,yes,0,16,9,083-652-659-570-250;;151-749-679-205-889;;161-862-698-016-052;;148-621-208-886-365;;196-806-218-094-515;;194-738-685-593-589;;197-963-156-445-580;;083-348-959-160-37X;;045-111-918-441-024,US;;AU;;WO,9,083-652-659-570-250;;151-749-679-205-889;;161-862-698-016-052;;196-806-218-094-515;;148-621-208-886-365;;194-738-685-593-589;;197-963-156-445-580;;083-348-959-160-37X;;045-111-918-441-024,US;;AU;;WO,0,G02B26/026;;F24S23/77;;F24S23/79;;F24S23/80;;F24S23/81;;F24S23/82;;F24S30/425;;F24S2023/85;;F24S2023/872;;F24S2030/11;;G02B26/0816;;G02F1/29;;Y02E10/47;;G02B26/026;;F24S23/77;;F24S23/79;;F24S23/80;;F24S23/81;;F24S23/82;;F24S30/425;;F24S2023/85;;F24S2023/872;;F24S2030/11;;G02F1/29;;Y02E10/47,F24S23/70;;G02B26/02,359/851;;359/853;;X1266;;126/684,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The specimens are placed in a vessel having a feuromagnetic capture structure supported on a transparent wall. The vessel is then placed in a magnetic field for inducing a high gradient region in the vicinity of the capture structure and, in particular, adjacent to the capture structure along the direction of the applied field. The magnetically responsive specimens are collected and immobilized by the high gradient along the wall adjacent to the capture structure for unobstructed microscopic observation. Subpapulations of distinct types of cells can thus be observed and differentiated.

In servo writer applications where servo code is prerecorded on the media, the alignment transitions can be used to align the write elements of a servo write head to the transport direction of the media so that inter band skew between adjacent servo bands is significantly reduced.",HEWLETT PACKARD DEVELOPMENT CO,BECK PATRICIA A;;CLIFFORD JR GEORGE M,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (2001-04-10);;HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2003-09-26),https://lens.org/032-350-355-163-249,Granted Patent,yes,20,94,14,184-107-928-400-347;;082-935-326-585-255;;165-337-713-129-056;;128-654-206-976-602;;013-477-375-180-766;;028-874-943-185-930;;032-350-355-163-249;;014-701-957-616-873;;102-081-368-534-461;;138-247-591-410-617;;085-804-265-727-641;;095-036-404-463-142;;034-178-751-311-355;;182-744-634-216-009,HK;;EP;;DE;;US;;KR;;CN;;JP,14,184-107-928-400-347;;082-935-326-585-255;;165-337-713-129-056;;128-654-206-976-602;;013-477-375-180-766;;028-874-943-185-930;;032-350-355-163-249;;014-701-957-616-873;;102-081-368-534-461;;138-247-591-410-617;;085-804-265-727-641;;095-036-404-463-142;;034-178-751-311-355;;182-744-634-216-009,HK;;EP;;DE;;US;;KR;;CN;;JP,0,G11B5/4893;;G11B5/00826;;G11B5/56;;G11B5/584;;G11B5/008;;G11B5/4893;;G11B5/00826;;G11B5/56;;G11B5/584,G11B5/58;;G11B5/008;;G11B5/29;;G11B5/48;;G11B5/56;;G11B5/584,360/76;;360/77.12,3,0,,,"Article Date: Jun., 2000, Magazine vol: 7 Issue: 6 Author: Jack Fegreus, Title: Next-Gen Tape Battle: Fast Heads vs. Fast Tape Data Storage.;;Article Date: Oct. 1997, Magazine vol: 4, Issue: 11, Author: Thomas Albrecht, Robert Barrett, and James Eaton, IBMTitle: Time-based, track-following servos for linear tape drives Data Storage.;;Article Date: Jun., 2000, Magazine vol: 7 Issue: 6 Author: Ralph Simmons, Hewlett-Packard, Title: Tape Update I: HDD Technologies key to Ultrium tape Data Storage.",EXPIRED
